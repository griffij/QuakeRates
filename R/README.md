#R

This directory contains R code for fitting earthquake occurrence models to paleo-earthquake data. The package R2JAGS is used to fit the models using Bayesian MCMC methods.

Models that attempt to fit real paleo-earthquake data are in the sub-directory models.

A series of simple test cases are in the sub-directory test_models.
