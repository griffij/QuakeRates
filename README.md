# QuakeRates
Code for analysis of long-term earthquake occurrence rates

This code is initially designed to calculate earthquake recurrence rates, and coefficients of variation, from palaeoseismology data. Inputs are expected to be probability distributions of earthquake occurrence times, such as the output from OxCal estimation of event dates. The code is developed with the aim of producing long-term time-dependent earthquake rate models for individual faults.
